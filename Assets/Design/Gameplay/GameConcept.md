# The Design Process
In participating in the Global Game Jam at UNC Charlotte, my teammate Miguel Jover and I had to think of a game that fit this year's theme: "roots". Here are some of our original ideas...
1. A game where the player controls water moving through dirt to reach a plant and help it grow, avoiding various underground obstacles in the process.
2. A game where the player grows a tree from the seed, rolling it around and picking up dirt and water in order to make it bigger and bigger until it becomes a full tree.
3. A game where the player starts out as the smallest form of life, such as an amoeba, and must complete actions to grow and evolve.

We ended up deciding on this game, *insert game name here*, by combining dozens of different ideas. The theme of this game is centered around "roots" in the concept of plant life.

## This Game - Continued Design Process
During the initial discussion, there was a game idea that was brought up between Miguel and I - a wizard who could control plants and make roots grow, maneuvering around a platformer style game with these plants. Some key points in this discussion included:

- being able to use a wand to make plants grow, utilzing this in order to cross platforms and create ladders.
- the core game mechanic being jumping, movement, and shooting magic.

We wanted this game to be full of plant life as the main character is solely controlling them to get around the world. So, we came up with the different categories of plants that are seen in this game:

- yellow plants that start as sprouts, and once come into contact with yellow magic, turn into a staircase or ladder for the player to reach higher platforms they normally couldn't reach.
- green plants that start as sprouts, and grow across platforms or large gaps once they come into contact with green magic. This allows the player to create a large leaf or lily pad to cross smaller gaps.
- green plants that are lower in deeper and larger gaps, that grow taller when hit with blue water magic. Upon being hit, the plant will rise to meet the floor of the platform, creating a seamless path for the player to continue on. This effect is temporary, however, and the player will need to hit the plant with blue magic again to move back up.

After deciding these factors, we decided to also make our main character a root - a potato to be precise. 

## The Art Process
After making some concept art of what the player could look like as a regular potato, we decided to create a cuter look, adorning it with a wizard hat, wizard robe, and some round glasses. Here are some rough sketches of what it started out as:

And here is where we ended up deciding on the final design:

And here is the final, in-game version of Spuddy we see in *insert game name here*

- put pixel spuddy here!

## The Story
We wanted to keep the idea fun and whimsical, matching the sentiment of a wand-wielding potato wizard. So, the goal of the game is as so: 
> *our potato wizard, Spuddy, must train to become the most powerful potato wizard to defeat any evil force that could threaten the peace of Spudonia.*

Working off of this, the next step was deciding what the scenery of our little Spuddy's adventure would be.

## Setting the Scene
Given this game is set in a world of sentient, magical potatoes, it only made sense for the landscape to match that sentiment as well. The color scheme was the first on the chopping block. We landed on a more earthy, yet vibrant color scheme to represent the land of Spudania.

- golden yellow: `#ffce54`	
- rich brown: `#8b5e3c`
- forest green: `#228b22`
- bright pink: `#ff6961`
- light green: `#90ee90`
- light pink: `#ffc0cb`
- light salmon: `#ffa07a`
- purple: `#9370db`
- red: `#dc143c`
- blue: `#5fa0f5`

After deciding colors, I went to the drawing board to come up with some level backgrounds. Level one is inspired by the idea of Spuddy starting on their quest right after leaving the kingdom, and features a lush forest filled with trees, mushrooms, and ferns where the player will learnt the basic mechanics and how the game works. Here is the rough sketch of level one:

And here is what that level ended up looking like in the final draft:

We had to keep our scope small due to the time restrictions (only 48 hours given to complete from start to finish), so we only planned for 3 levels. I wanted to bring some mystery into level two, so it is themed around a misty, enchanted swamp featuring lily pads, gnarled trees, and dangerous waters. Here is the rough sketch for level two:

For level 3, I wanted to make it so the game could feel finished (though it's more of a prototype right now), so I opted to go for a glowing, crystal-coated cave scene. At the end of the cave, our potato wizard finds a more powerful wand, and then it cuts to a scene where our potato wizard stands proud and tall, basking in their success as the sun sets over the kingdom, the world bathed in a warm and magical glow. Below is the rough sketch for the final level, as well as the ending scene:

![Rough Draft - Ending Sequence](/Assets/Design/Gameplay/Gameplay Concept Art/ending-scene-rough-draft.jpg)

and here are the final drafts of those scenes:

- level 2 final bg
- level 3 final bg
- ending scene final

After finishing the levels and ending, the next thing to tackle was the title screen and user interface. 

## Sound Conceptualization
Given the time constraints, sound is a huge 'if' for this project. But, if time allows, this will be updated to show the MuseScore scores created for each level. In terms of conceptualization, this was the blueprint:

- **Title Screen:**: a whimsical and airy sound, major key, upbeat but not too many fast rhytms. Similar to Ocarina of Time overture.
- **Level One:** a whimsical tune but getting more fast and upbeat as our hero starts their journey. More eight note rhythms, more happy sounding - similar to the Kokiri Forest theme in Ocarina of Time.
- **Level Two:** More mysterious and slow - more of a grave sound. Longer notes, accidentals, and a more minor key overall. An eerie feel to the level overall.
- **Level Three:** Less mysterious and more treacherous - a feeling of dread, but a tone of confidence through feeling that.
- **Ending Sequence:** Same as title screen score, but grander, bigger band and strings included, a sense of pride felt while hearing it

other music to take into consideration:
- **Death Screen:** same as title screen but in minor key, accidentals, possibly inverted - makes the player feel dread for death
